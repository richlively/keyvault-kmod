The scull code in LDD3 is too old to run on modern linux kernels.  However the
authors have managed to keep the code updated on GitHub at:
  https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3.

I downloaded the entire source repository as a zip, unzipped it on john.  Then
I logged onto my LFS machine and used sftp (which I had installed earlier) to
move the first of the scull examples (the one from Chapter 3) to the LFS
machine.

To make the scull source more easiy understood, I removed references to the
additional devices (e.g., scullpipe, sculla, etc.) and also thoroughly
commented the code and improved the formatting.

In order to make the kernel module, I simpified the Makefile to be more like
the one from the hello world example.  This may not have been necessary, but
it was successful.

The LLD text suggested that we could "see" what's happening in the execution
of the scull module using strace.  The ordinary LFS installation does not
include strace, but it can be found at:  
  http://igor-zivkovic.from.hr/BLFS/general/strace.html.

Finally, I also found a program online from course at Florida State University
on writing device drivers that tested scull.  That web location is:
  http://www.cs.uni.edu/~diesburg/courses/dd/code.html.

What now remains is a simplified version of scull which should be modified
to implement HW4.
