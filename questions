- How many devices should be loaded?
A: you can get away with just one device
- When there are concurrent users, do they use the same device or each have their own seperate device? Does it depend on the application program?
A: all users hit the same device
- Each device is its own seperate copy of the module, right?
- Do we need a file pointer outside of the key-vault structure? i.e. a file pointer that is part of our kv_mod_dev struct?
A: already in key-vault
char* seek_key should be in key vault but since it isn't making it global would be easier for this time around
- Only write the functions that we need plus any additional helper functions, right?
- How can we work on this off-campus over thanksgiving break?
A:  1 - can run a VM on personal laptop and do work from there
            in S drive in CS3610 look in licenses.txt
    2 - use selfservice to connect to john then ssh into LFS machine
- Some of the test programs open /dev/kv_mod0 and others open /dev/kv_mod. What is with the incosistency?
A: just call it kv_mod in test files

- do I need scull_follow and other helper functions? I would think key_vault would take care of this
- I already have a linux partition on my laptop. Would it be better to switch to VM if I only will use Linux for coding?
- is ctrl+z the best way to 'pause' vim to check on console?



- undefined key vault functions?
